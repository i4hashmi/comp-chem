        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>Dr. Muhammad Ali Hashmi is a Research Fellow at the School of Chemical and Physical Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. His academic background spans both Computational Chemistry and Natural Product Chemistry. He earned his first PhD in Natural Product Chemistry from COMSATS University Islamabad, Abbottabad Campus, in October 2016 — a milestone that marked the beginning of his academic journey. 
Driven by a strong interest in theoretical and computational approaches, he pursued a second PhD in Computational Chemistry at Victoria University of Wellington, completing it in May 2018. Following his doctoral studies, Dr. Hashmi joined the University of Management and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan, as an Assistant Professor under the Higher Education Commission’s Interim Placement of Fresh PhDs (IPFP) program in October 2018. He then transitioned to the University of Education, Lahore, in March 2019, where he continued his academic contributions as an Assistant Professor under the Tenure Track System (TTS).
In June 2024, he returned to Victoria University of Wellington to begin a Postdoctoral Fellowship, where he is currently engaged in cutting-edge research in computational chemistry.</p>
